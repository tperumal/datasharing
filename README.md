## About Me

Hi, I’m Todd — a product builder, writer, and creative generalist based in Northern California.

By day, I lead growth and platform teams at a fintech startup. By night (and weekends), I’m learning to code, writing short stories, launching side projects, and figuring out what it means to build a life that feels like mine.

This site is my home base. It’s where I collect what I’ve built, what I’m learning, and what I care about — across product, AI, writing, film, and identity. Sometimes it’s polished. Sometimes it’s raw. Always, it’s in progress.

You’ll find:

- Work projects and case studies  
- Learning tracks and build logs  
- Essays, film reviews, and short fiction  
- Experiments in systems, code, and creative process

Everything here is part of a larger project: becoming more myself, in public.
